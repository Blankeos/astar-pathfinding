# ðŸ—º A\* Pathfinding Implemented in Unity

Using this as a prototype for Highway Blade's pathfinding for enemies.

Based on [TaroDev's Video on Understanding A\* Pathfinding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0x5fj4PqP4)

I simplified the implementation without any modularity for other types of Grids (Isometric, Hexagonal, Square). It only works for Square grids. I also limited the direction vectors to only 4 directions--Up, down, left, and right, which will be the only directional vectors for most entities in Highway Blade.
